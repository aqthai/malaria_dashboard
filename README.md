#### The information is from https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/total-number-of-malaria-cases-presumed-confirmed-cases
#### It's purpose is to inform health agencies.  This information can alarm viewers, as it did for me.  Millions of malaria cases are reported annually and the count increases with time.  This counters my presemptions of healthcare evolving with time.  Even with advancing technology, other countries continue to suffer.  I became curious after reading _The Malaria Capiliaries_ by Robert S. Desowitz six years after passing an college biology class without reading it.
